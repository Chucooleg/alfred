                    <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
                    <p>Thank you for taking the time to consider volunteering in a Microsoft Corporation research 
                    project. This form explains what would happen if you join this research project. Please read it 
                    carefully and take as much time as you need. Email the study team to ask about anything that is not clear. Participation in this study is voluntary and you may withdraw at any time.</p>
                    <h5>TITLE OF RESEARCH PROJECT</h5>
                    <p>Alfred Speaks: Instruction Generation for Embodied Agents</p>
                    <h5>PURPOSE</h5>
                    <p>The goal of this study is to evaluate the accuracy and fluency of auto-generated instructions 
                    for embodied virtual agents.</p>
                    <h5>PROCEDURES</h5>
                    <p>During this project, the following will happen: you will first be provided instructions, 
                    a video of a virtual agent's actions, textual descriptions of these actions, and asked a series 
                    of questions about these descriptions. The study will take approximately 5-10 minutes to 
                    complete. We recommend running the study on the latest Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome browser. 
                    Microsoft will collect the numeric assessments you provide.</p>
                    <h5>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h5>
                    <p><strong>Personal information we collect:</strong> During the project we will not collect personal information about you. The data 
                    collection is anonymous, and we ask you to not disclose any personal information in the survey. We do collect an identifier that is provided as a parameter in the study URL but this identifier is not personally linked and is used only to authenticate your participation.</p>
                    <p><strong>How we use the data we collect:</strong> The data from the study will be used to conduct research and 
                    development into embodied virtual agents.</p>
                    <p><strong>How we store data:</strong> The data we collect will stored for a period of up to 18 months or less.</p>
                    <p>For additional information or concerns about how Microsoft handles personal information for

                    expected as a result of being in this study. The research team expects to better understand how 
                    to design systems that teach or explain the actions of an embodied virtual agent. You will receive 
                    any public benefit that may come these Research Results being shared with the greater scientific community.</p>
                    <p><strong>Risks:</strong> There are no anticipated, foreseeable risks or discomforts to you as a result of being in this study.</p>
